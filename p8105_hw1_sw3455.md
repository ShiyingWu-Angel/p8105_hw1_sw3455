All the needed package will be download in here.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

For problem 1, after download `palmerpenguins` package, I read
`penguins` data from the package `palmerpenguins`. And then we summary
the penguins data in order to collect names and values of these
important variables.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguin data have 8 columns which means have 8 variables and 344
rows means 344 observations.The 8 variables are species, island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
year.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The species variable is contain categorical value of 3 species of
  penguins, Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

- The island variable is also contain categorical value, 3 islan,d that
  penguins exhibit, including Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen.

- The bill_length_mm variable contain the numerical value of length of
  penguin length in milliliter in between 32.1mm to 59.6mm with a mean
  of 43.9219298 mm.

- The bill_depth_mm variable contain the numerical value of depth of
  penguin bill in milliliter in between 13.1mm to 21.5mm with a mean of
  17.1511696 mm.

- The flipper_length_mm variable contain the numerical value of length
  of penguin flipper in milliliter in between 172mm to 231mm with a mean
  of 200.9152047 mm.

- The body_mass_g variable contain the numerical value of weight for
  penguins in gram in between 2700g to 6300g with a mean of
  4201.754386g.

- The sex variable contain categorical value of penguins gender, male
  and female.

- The year variable contain the numerical value of the year for penguins
  been studies in from 2007 to 2009.

Then I used the ggplot formula to create the plot that
`flipper_length_mm` is y and `bill_length_mm` is x with color based on
species. The geom_point() is for scatter plot. Due to there are warning
based on there are missing value existed in the data, so we used
geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) to remove the missing value.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(y = flipper_length_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
```

```

## Problem 2

For problem 2, we used the tibble to create data frame that contain four
type of variable. And then take mean on each variable to check which
type would the mean() works.Due to there is warning when we taking mean
beside of numerical and logical variable, we use warning = FALSE to
remove it.

``` r
p2_df = 
  tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
    vec_logic = vec_numeric>0,
    vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("Apple","Bee","Cat","Apple","Bee","Cat","Apple","Bee","Cat","Apple"))
  )

mean(pull(p2_df, vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] 0.1318918

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## [1] NA

Based on result and warning, we find out that both numeric and logical
type could be works by take mean of it, but other two type, character
and factor, can not work by take mean of it. Due to we do not need to
print result, so I use eval = FALSE

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_logic)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_char)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_factor)))
```

The logical type still getting same solution as previous by taking the
mean directly. Character type is still not working even after numeric
it, all value just transfer into NA. Factor type works on mean() after
transfer into numeric value. It transfer into 1,2,and 3, in three factor
cases, and then get the mean of it.
