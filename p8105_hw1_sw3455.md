All the needed package will be download in here.

```

## Problem 1

For problem 1, after download `palmerpenguins` package, I read
`penguins` data from the package `palmerpenguins`. And then we summary
the penguins data in order to collect names and values of these
important variables.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
summary(penguins)
```

    ##       species          island    bill_length_mm  bill_depth_mm  
    ##  Adelie   :152   Biscoe   :168   Min.   :32.10   Min.   :13.10  
    ##  Chinstrap: 68   Dream    :124   1st Qu.:39.23   1st Qu.:15.60  
    ##  Gentoo   :124   Torgersen: 52   Median :44.45   Median :17.30  
    ##                                  Mean   :43.92   Mean   :17.15  
    ##                                  3rd Qu.:48.50   3rd Qu.:18.70  
    ##                                  Max.   :59.60   Max.   :21.50  
    ##                                  NA's   :2       NA's   :2      
    ##  flipper_length_mm  body_mass_g       sex           year     
    ##  Min.   :172.0     Min.   :2700   female:165   Min.   :2007  
    ##  1st Qu.:190.0     1st Qu.:3550   male  :168   1st Qu.:2007  
    ##  Median :197.0     Median :4050   NA's  : 11   Median :2008  
    ##  Mean   :200.9     Mean   :4202                Mean   :2008  
    ##  3rd Qu.:213.0     3rd Qu.:4750                3rd Qu.:2009  
    ##  Max.   :231.0     Max.   :6300                Max.   :2009  
    ##  NA's   :2         NA's   :2

The penguin data have 8 columns which means have 8 variables and 344
rows means 344 observations. Based on the `summary(penguins)`, The 8
variables are species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. The mean of flipper length is
200.9152047 mm.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(y = flipper_length_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

## Problem 2

For problem 2

``` r
p2_df = 
  tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
    vec_logic = vec_numeric>0,
    vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("Apple","Bee","Cat","Apple","Bee","Cat","Apple","Bee","Cat","Apple"))
  )
mean(p2_df$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] -0.5165055

``` r
mean(p2_df$vec_logic)
```

    ## [1] 0.1

``` r
mean(p2_df %>% pull(vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] -0.5165055

``` r
mean(p2_df %>% pull(vec_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.1

``` r
mean(p2_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(p2_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(p2_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(p2_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(p2_df %>% pull(vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(p2_df %>% pull(vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(p2_df %>% pull(vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(p2_df %>% pull(vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

By previous output, we find out that both numeric and logical type could
be works by take mean of it, but other two type, character and factor,
can not work by take mean of it.

``` r
mean(as.numeric(p2_df %>% pull(vec_logic)))
mean(as.numeric(p2_df %>% pull(vec_char)))
mean(as.numeric(p2_df %>% pull(vec_factor)))
```

The logical type still getting same solution as previous by taking the
mean directly. Character type is still not working even after numeric
it, all value just transfer into NA. Factor type works on mean() after
transfer into numeric value. It transfer into 1,2,and 3, in three factor
cases, and then get the mean of it.
